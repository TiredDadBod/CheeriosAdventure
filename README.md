# CheeriosAdventure
My first side scroller following a bunny that must collect carrots and fight off snakes and a big wolf.

There are currently 20 randomly generated Carrots to collect, 10 randomly generated Snakes to defeat, and 1 Big Wolf to fight.

Along the path there are randomly placed rocks and puddles, the rocks must be jumped on or over and the puddles do nothing, however, I tried to ensure the bunny would slow down while walking through them unless he is running, but only the first puddle works.

There is a Main Menu, Pause Menu, Game Over, and Level Complete Screens.

The HUD shows Carrots collected / left, Time, Score, Lives, and Health.
