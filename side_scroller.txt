This will be the first side scroller I am going to make alone, again with minimal help.

The objective of the game will be similar to that of Mario or Sonic with an additional objective.
Tasks that need to be completed:
-Create background image for side scroller
-Create character for game
    - Ensure character can move left and right and jump
-Create obstacles to jump on and over
-Create enemies to avoid and possibly defeat
    -Optional: Give enemies attack capabilities
-Set main objective
    -Ensure there is an end to finish attack
    -Set either ranking system or Pass/Fail system
